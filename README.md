Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Django] - Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code.
* [Python-Venv] - The venv module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own site directories
* [MySQL] - MySQL is an Oracle-backed open source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL).
